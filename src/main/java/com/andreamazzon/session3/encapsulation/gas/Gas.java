 * This class shows the use of encapsulation in order to manage access control:

 * However, we work with Kelvin. We have therefore to let him/her give and read
 * degrees Fahrenheit, through public getters and setters, and then perform a
 * conversion from Fahrenheit to Kelvin, and vice versa. These methods to
 * perform conversions should be private: the client is only interested on
 * Fahrenheit.
