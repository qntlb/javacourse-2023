/**
 * This class is strictly related to com.andreamazzon.session2.mortgages.Mortgage, that was an example of a
 * possible use of static fields in order to know the total amount of money we lend to clients. We had a static field
 * loansSum whose value was therefore shared by all the objects of Mortgage and got incremented every time
 * such an object is created. We had printed a warning message as soon as the value of this field was bigger than
 * a maximum. However, we could not find a a way to prevent the possibility to produce more object after that time.
 * A solution is now to have a private constructor, which is called only if loansSum <= budget.
