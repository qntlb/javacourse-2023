/**
 * The only class of this package shows some examples of the uses of Streams: Streams
 * are wrappers around a data source, which allow us to operate with that data source
 * more conveniently and faster than with arrays and lists. In particular, we ses how to:
 * - check if it is true or not that there exists at least an element of a stream
 * which satisfies one property
 * - check if it is true or not that all elements of a stream satisfy one property
 * - how to filter a Stream, that is, how to delete the elements of the stream
 * that do not satisfy a given property.
 * - how to apply an operation to all elements of a Stream, and save the Stream
 * obtained in this way in another Stream.
