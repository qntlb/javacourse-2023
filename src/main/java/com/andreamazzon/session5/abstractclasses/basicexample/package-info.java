/**
 * This package illustrates a first basic example of abstract classes. You can note that we can only
 * create objects of classes inheriting from the abstract class, not directly of the type of the abstract class.
 * Indeed, they could not call the (not implemented!) abstract method. However, in the class OtherClass you can see
 * that thanks to late binding you can define a method whose argument is AbstractBaseClass:
 * this is another example of polymorphism.
