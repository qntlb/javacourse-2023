/**
 * Here you can see an example of why abstract classes can be useful: look at com.andreamazzon.session4.polymorphism.shapes.Shape
 * Here we had to give a dummy implementation to the method computeArea(), which is overridden in the derived classes
 * Circle, Triangle and Square. This method should be abstract, as it is now, and thus the Shape class must be abstract
 * as well. Note again an example of polymorphism in ShapeTest.
