/**
 * In this package we illustrate a first example of interface: this interface is a "completely abstract"
 * class, as it only gives the returning type, name and arguments lists of the methods that a class
 * "implementing" that interface must implement, and a final, static field. It provides the
 * "form" of a class implementing this interface, but not the implementation.
