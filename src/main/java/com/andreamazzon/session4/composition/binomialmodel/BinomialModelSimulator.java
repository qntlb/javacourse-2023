/**
 * This class is used in order to simulate some paths of a binomial model, get  the value of the
 * process at given times and for some paths and to compute the average at some times.
 * The binomial model is a discrete model for a stochastic process S, such that every time i we have
 * S(i+1)=S(i)*M(i), where M(i)=u>1+r with probability p and M(i)=d<1 with probability 1-p,
 * where r is the risk free interest rate.
 * This is done under the risk neutral measure: it can be seen that it must hold
 * p=(1 + r - d)/(u - d).
 * This serves as an example of composition: the class has an object of type LinearCongruentialGenerator,
 * which is used to generate the realizations M(i).
 * Also note that methods used to generate the process are private. We have instead public methods that
 * provide the user with data she/he can be interested about: for example, the method getRealizations()
 * returns a matrix whose rows are all the simulations for a fixed time and the columns are the paths
 * for a given simulation. The realizations of a row are realizations of a random variable.
 * We will see how a random variable can be implemented in the Finmath library.
