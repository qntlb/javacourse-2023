/**
 * In this test we show an example of polymorphism. We have a for loop where we generate a
 * shape at every iteration, asking it to call the method computing its area.
 * However, until run time we don't know if it is a circle, square or triangle, the shapes are
 * even selected randomly. Nevertheless, we are able to do this because the objects
 * of the derived classes get upcasted to the base type when they are created (see the method
 * nextShape() of RandomShapeGenerator).
 * Every object is then treated as a Shape at compilation time, but at run time its special type
 * is recognized and the specific implementation of the method computeArea() is called.
 * This behavior is known as late binding: the code being called isnâ€™t determined until run time.
