/**
 * This classes illustrates overriding, upcasting and polymorphism.
 * Three methods are defined and implemented for the parent class amphibian. Then the same methods are
 * re-implemented (= overridden) in the two derived classes. 
 * Note the type of the argument of the method behavior: it accepts a reference to an object of type Amphibian.
 * However, it can also be called by passing objects with a reference of Frog or Toad: they get upcasted when
 * the method is called. In this way, the code doesn’t rely on the specific type of the objects at compilation time,
 * but its execution does (which is what we want).
 * This is an effect of late binding: at compilation time Java looks at the reference of the objects (the first name
 * of the class you write when you construct the object) and at running time it looks at the specific type of the
 * object which is attached to that reference.
